Hinglish Prompt Engineering Explanation:

The prompt achieves authentic Hinglish by combining structural constraints with cultural linguistic patterns and one-shot learning. 

1. Phonetic Spelling: Enforces phonetic spelling (e.g., instead of 'achcha', write 'ach-chaaa' for emphasis.).

2. Hindi Grammar: Includes ergative case rules ("unhone" for actions vs "unki" for possession), promoting Urban Hinglish.

3. Code-Switching: English sentences ending with Hindi tags like "hai na?" and "yaarrr".

4. Conversational Elements: Fillers, interruptions, and bracketed emotions ([laughs], [sighs]).

5. One-Shot Learning: Includes a concrete example demonstrating the desired style.

6. Duration Control: Exactly 14 lines (7 per host) and 300-400 words for a 2-minute conversation between two people.

This combination trains the LLM to generate natural, grammatically correct Hinglish dialogue.
