# Hinglish Prompt Engineering Explanation

The prompt achieves authentic Hinglish by combining structural constraints with cultural linguistic patterns and one-shot learning.

## Key Components

### 1. Phonetic Spelling
Enforces phonetic spelling (e.g., instead of `'achcha'`, write `'ach-chaaa'` for emphasis).

### 2. Hindi Grammar
Includes ergative case rules:
- `"unhone"` for actions
- `"unki"` for possession

This promotes **Urban Hinglish** authenticity.

### 3. Code-Switching
English sentences ending with Hindi tags like:
- `"hai na?"`
- `"yaarrr"`

### 4. Conversational Elements
Includes:
- Fillers
- Interruptions
- Bracketed emotions: `[laughs]`, `[sighs]`

### 5. One-Shot Learning
Includes a concrete example demonstrating the desired style.

### 6. Duration Control
- Exactly **14 lines** (7 per host)
- **300-400 words** for a 2-minute conversation between two people

## Result

This combination trains the LLM to generate natural, grammatically correct Hinglish dialogue.
